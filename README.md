# neuro_trends
This is a mini-project to predict age and other assessment features(d1v1, d1v2, d2v1, d2v2) from the sbm_loadings and fnc_mappings in tabular form.
It can be categorized into:

a. basic_eda

b. experiments

c. stacking_individual ( which contains stacking_tree_models.ipynb, stacking_gbt_models.ipynb, stacking_linear_models.ipynb, stacking_svr_models.ipynb )

d. final_stacking

PS : There are many stacking softwares available like Stacknet, but the stacking had to be done separately for linear models and others because of the gpu requirements.

Also, the data is kept private because of organisation's code of conduct.
