# neuro_trends
This is a mini-project to predict age and other assessment features(d1v1, d1v2, d2v1, d2v2) from the sbm_loadings and fnc_mappings in tabular form.
It can be categorized into:

a. basic_eda

b. experiments

c. stacking_individual ( which contains stacking_tree_models.ipynb, stacking_gbt_models.ipynb, stacking_linear_models.ipynb, stacking_svr_models.ipynb )

d. final_stacking

PS : There are many stacking softwares available like Stacknet, but the stacking had to be done separately for linear models and others because of the gpu requirements.
